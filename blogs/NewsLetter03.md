# Your Weekly Dose of Protocol Updates with ECH!
Strengthening Ethereum standards, governance, and public-goods infrastructure
## Overview
Another week of deep protocol work, core discussions, and ecosystem coordination across Ethereum. Here’s everything ECH Institute worked on this week.
This week, **[ECH Institute](https://x.com/ECHInstitute)** continued its mission to make Ethereum’s core development more open, accessible, and community-led. Through technical meetings, discussions, and public goods sessions, the team helped connect developers, researchers, and community members from across the ecosystem. Each session played a role in strengthening Ethereum’s upgrade process, improving standards, and supporting long-term sustainability. Together, these efforts ensure that Ethereum remains secure, transparent, and built for everyone.
Below is Protocol Post Edition #3, covering major protocol-focused sessions from January 19–22, 2026.
## All Core Devs Testing (ACDT #66)
This session focused on coordinated testing across Ethereum client teams to identify potential issues ahead of upcoming network changes. Participants discussed testnet progress, tooling improvements, and feedback loops between researchers and implementers. These calls help ensure protocol updates are thoroughly tested before deployment.
