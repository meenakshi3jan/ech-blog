Your Weekly Dose of Protocol Updates with ECH!
Strengthening Ethereum standards, governance, and public-goods infrastructure

## Overview

This week, [ECH Institute](https://x.com/ECHInstitute) continued supporting Ethereum’s core development and public-goods ecosystem. Our focus remains the same: keep everything open, accessible, and community-driven. 

Here’s what we worked on this week.

## Protocol Support & Accessibility
We livestreamed All Core Devs – Execution Layer(ACDE #228) and All Core Devs – Testing (ACDT #65) meetings to ensure full transparency for the Ethereum community. These sessions bridge the gap between protocol researchers and the wider ecosystem by making technical conversations open and easy to follow. We also shared recaps and podcast episodes so builders can stay updated without attending live calls. A big thanks to [Aakash](https://x.com/lookupforsky) for consistently supporting the ecosystem and helping strengthen our shared mission.

## EIP Editing Office Hours
[ECH Institute](https://x.com/ECHInstitute) hosted EIP Editing Office Hours to guide contributors through Ethereum’s proposal process. This week, ECH Institute hosted another EIP Editing Office Hours session to strengthen clarity and participation across EIP and ERC workflows. The call provided a collaborative space for contributors, editors, and community members to ask questions, review proposals, and better understand the Ethereum standards process. By making these discussions open and accessible, ECH continues to bridge core development conversations with the wider ecosystem, helping more builders confidently engage in Ethereum’s governance and improvement process. Special thanks to [Victor Zhou](https://x.com/ZainanZhou) for leading the session.

## Community Knowledge & Coordination
We published simplified recaps and discussions to translate core development updates into community-friendly language. This helps ensure protocol changes are understood beyond developer circles. Open knowledge strengthens Ethereum’s coordination and long-term resilience.
### Octant Epoch 10 — Public Goods Funding
[ECH Institute](https://x.com/ECHInstitute) participated in [Octant Epoch 10](https://x.com/OctantApp), with [Pooja Ranjan](https://x.com/poojaranjan19) representing the organization during a live community session. The discussion featured several impactful projects that are helping shape the Ethereum ecosystem and strengthen open coordination, governance, and public-goods infrastructure.
This live engagement highlighted ECH Institute’s continued role in supporting Ethereum-aligned initiatives and collaborating with builders across the global ecosystem.

## Power of Community Support
If ECH Institute’s work has helped you navigate Ethereum, your support directly fuels our mission. Every contribution helps us continue providing protocol calls, documentation, and community coordination. Together, we keep Ethereum open, resilient, and community-owned.
